## Haar-Cascade Face Detection Algorithm

t is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image
or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection
features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper “Rapid
Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features”
published in 2001.
