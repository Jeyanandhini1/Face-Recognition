# Face-Recognition

## Haar-Cascade Face Detection Algorithm

It is an Object Detection Algorithm used to identify faces in an image
or a real time video. The algorithm uses edge or line detection
features proposed by Viola and Jones in their research paper “Rapid
Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features”
published in 2001.

## Project Goals

The objective of face recognition is, from the incoming image, to find
a series of data of the same face in a set of training images in a database.
The great difficulty is ensuring that this process is carried out in real-
time, something that is not available to all biometric facial recognition
software providers.
